# My-Vim-Config

###### Purpose:
- The purpose of this vim repository is to document the creation of my own .vimrc file for education purposes.


###### Do's and Don'ts
- Do: Review my documentation to understand how vim can be configured for YOUR ideal work environment.
- Do: Use it as a framework to get started in creating your own documentation.
- Don't: Copy my .vimrc file.
	- You will learn nothing by copying my .vimrc file or understand what/how to use any plug          ins or modifications.
	- You will have a bunch of features you won't know you have/won't know how to use/may never use.
